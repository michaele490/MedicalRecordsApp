# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Tutorial:

* Run 'bundle install'
* Run 'rails db:migrate'
* Run 'rails server'

Notes:

- Run application either in 'secure_branch' or 'unsecure_branch', main branch is not up to date
- To run tests make sure you use a version of chromedriver which is compatible with Chrome 135
